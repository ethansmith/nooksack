        <h2>Why Now?</h2>
        <p>
          The Nooksack River watershed is at a crossroads. Water rights adjudication, climate change, and economic pressures are converging on a landscape that is home to Indigenous nations, family farms, vibrant communities, and irreplaceable salmon runs. For too long, solutions have been imposed from above, dividing communities and undermining the ecosystems we all depend on.

        <p>
          We believe that the future belongs to those who can come together across differences, weaving relationships and stories that honor both people and place. The Nooksack Bioregional Stewardship Initiative is about reclaiming our collective agency to care for our watershed—by working with, not against, each other and the land.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          We envision a future where the Nooksack watershed thrives—ecologically, culturally, and economically—because its people have chosen collaboration over conflict, stewardship over extraction, and abundance over scarcity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our initiative does not seek to replace or duplicate existing efforts. Instead, we aim to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Articulate a shared vision for watershed stewardship rooted in Indigenous leadership, local knowledge, and scientific insight.</li>
          <li>Weave together the work of dozens of organizations, agencies, and community groups, amplifying what’s already working.</li>
          <li>Provide platforms for honest discourse, storytelling, and learning—so that every voice is heard and every story matters.</li>
          <li>Seed a bioregional financing facility to support long-term, place-based regeneration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We recognize that the path forward is uncertain and nonlinear. Our role is to help the community navigate complexity, embrace ambiguity, and build adaptive resilience for whatever comes next.

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          We focus on relationships first, solutions second. We believe that trust, humility, and shared purpose are the foundation for any lasting change. Our work includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dialogue & Storytelling:</strong> Hosting gatherings, film screenings, and community forums to surface shared values and lived experiences.</li>
          <li><strong>Weaving Networks:</strong> Mapping and connecting existing efforts, helping organizations see themselves as part of a larger story.</li>
          <li><strong>Governance Innovation:</strong> Supporting experiments in collaborative decision-making that respect both Indigenous sovereignty and local agency.</li>
          <li><strong>Bioregional Finance:</strong> Laying the groundwork for a long-term, place-based financing facility that supports regeneration, not extraction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our initiative is adaptive by design. We recognize that we are operating in a world of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. We don’t have all the answers, and we’re not afraid to say so. What we do have is a commitment to learning, listening, and evolving together.
